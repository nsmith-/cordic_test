Use ./make.sh to make

Comparing emulator with xilinx closed source library:
Test integer inputs with ./test 123 456
Run some unit circle and preliminary hardware-compare checks with ./test (anything)

Comparing emulator/library with FPGA captures:
./readDat captureFile.dat
Adjust latency
./readDat captureFile.dat #cycles

Captures are expected to be in hex format [2 bit pad][24 bit x][24 bit y][19 bit mag][19 bit phase]\n
e.g. 3FFED83FFF390000CFD7E0
An example file is nicksCordicOutput.dat
